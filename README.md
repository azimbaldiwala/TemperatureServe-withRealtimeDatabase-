# TemperatureServe-withRealtimeDatabase

I have made this small IoT project using nodemcu as microcontroller.

Nodemcu collects temperature and humidity using dht11 and then display it to a webpage.

Now python scrapper gets that data from a web page and stores that into a sqlite3 databas.

I have also made a flask webserver to view the data or download the data.
